# AUR package for Calamares

I need my custom [Calamares](https://codeberg.org/Calamares/calamares) package for [Miladi](https://github.com/yuki/miladi), and Arch Linux one is not upgraded.

I decided to create my own package.

## BUILD

```
sudo runuser -unobody makepkg
```

In order to execute, it will need a config file. I have the configuration in [miladi-calamares-config](https://github.com/yuki/miladi-calamares-config).
